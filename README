# OS Scheduling Simulator with Multi-Level Feedback Queue and Round Robin Scheduling

## About
***
This program serves as an Operating System scheduling simulator, featuring with both Multi-Level Feedback Queue algorithm and Round Robin scheduling.

## Technology Stack
***
Built using the C programming language, this simulator highlights the efficient of OS scheduling.

## Key Features
***
- **Multi-Level Feedback Queue:**
  - Prioritizes processes based on their behavior and execution history.
  - Employs different queues with varying time quantum for each priority level.
  - Prevents starvation by dynamically adjusting priorities.

- **Round Robin Scheduling:**
  - Incorporates the classic Round Robin algorithm for fair time-sharing among processes.
  - Enhances fairness and responsiveness for shorter processes.
  - Balances the trade-off between fairness and system efficiency.

## Simulator Behavior
***
- **Dynamic Scheduling:**
  - The simulator adapts its scheduling approach based on the process behavior and priority.
  - MLFQ dynamically adjusts priorities, and Round Robin provides fair execution.

- **Process Interaction:**
  - User processes communicate with the scheduler through messages, reporting execution details.
  - MLFQ and Round Robin together simulate a responsive and balanced system.

## Getting Started
***
1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/anhb8/os-scheduling-simulator.git`
2. **Compile the Code:** `make`
3. **Run the Simulator:** `./scheduler`
a. `./oss -h` : Display help menu
b. `./oss -s t`: Specify maximum seconds before the system terminates 
c. `./oss -l f` : Specify a particular name for the log file

t: Maximum time in seconds after which the process should terminate itself if not completed 
f: Filename 

## Cleaning
***
To clean or remove compiled files, you can use the following command: `make clean`
